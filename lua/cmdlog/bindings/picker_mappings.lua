---@module 'cmdlog.bindings.picker_mappings'
--- Descriptive catalog of the in-picker keymaps implemented in
--- lua/cmdlog/ui/mappings.lua. This file registers nothing itself — it exists
--- so docs/BINDINGS.md and `:checkhealth`/introspection tooling have a single
--- place to read the current set of picker keys from `config.options.mappings`.

local M = {}

--- CDX: incomplete -- `config.options.mappings` has 10 configurable keys
--- (toggle_selection, tag, cycle_source, undo_favorite, move_favorite_up/down
--- are missing here), and docs/BINDINGS.md says this file "mirrors" the full
--- picker-keymap table. `M.resolved()` feeds `bindings.catalog()`.
---@type table<string, {config_key: string, desc: string}>
