--- Optional normal-mode entry-point keymaps for `:Cmdlog` and its
--- subcommands. Every keymap set here carries a `desc`, so which-key.nvim
--- (v3+) picks it up automatically without any extra registration step.
---
--- Configured as a map of subcommand -> lhs, with `""` meaning bare
--- `:Cmdlog`:
---
---   keymaps = { [""] = "<leader>hc", favorites = "<leader>hf" }
---
--- The catalog is derived from `bindings.usrcmds` rather than restated, so a
--- newly added subcommand is mappable immediately with no second list to keep
--- in sync.

--- Keys are subcommand names (`""` for bare `:Cmdlog`), values carry the
--- command to run and the description shown by which-key.

--- name check kept *here*: the action names are the `:Cmdlog` subcommands, so
--- naming the offending one against that catalog says more than a nearest
--- match would -- and a rejected name is filtered out before the registry
--- sees it, so nothing warns twice.
