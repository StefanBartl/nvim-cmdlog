---@module 'cmdlog.bindings.usrcmds'
--- Single source of truth for the `:Cmdlog` user command and its subcommands.
---
--- Two changes met here. The command surface moved from seven flat
--- `:CmdlogX` commands to one `:Cmdlog <subcommand>` verb built on
--- lib.nvim.bindings.usercmd.composer; and its registration site moved out of
--- `lua/cmdlog/ui/picker.lua` into this bindings/ module, so
--- docs/BINDINGS.md and the code cannot drift apart.
---
--- `M.catalog` stays the machine-readable description (consumed by
--- `cmdlog.bindings.catalog()` and the docs), while `M.register()` feeds it
--- to composer. Adding a subcommand means adding one entry to `M.catalog`.

local M = {}

--- Every `:Cmdlog` subcommand. `path` is the token the user types; the entry
--- with `path = nil` is the bare `:Cmdlog` default.
