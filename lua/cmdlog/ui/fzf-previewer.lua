---@module 'cmdlog.ui.fzf-previewer'
--- Builds the fzf-lua previewer for command-history entries.
---
--- fzf-lua's previewer contract is a shell command string it runs itself, so
--- everything here is a shell string and every value interpolated into one has
--- to be escaped -- otherwise a history entry like `:help x | rm -rf .` is an
--- injection into the previewer's own shell. `cmdlog.ui.preview_policy` rejects
--- an argument that could end the command, and `shellescape` covers the rest.
---
--- What may be previewed how is that module's decision, not this one's: a
--- preview reads, it does not run. See it for why.
---
--- The `:edit` branch shells out to `head`, which is POSIX-only, as is the
--- pipe-to-redir one-liner the other branches need. Rather than emit a broken
--- preview command on Windows, this returns nil there (fzf-lua's "no preview"
--- state). The Telescope previewer (cmdlog.ui.telescope-previewer) reads the
--- file in-process and works everywhere.

---A shell one-liner that renders `vim_cmd` in a throwaway Neovim and prints

---not a fixed name in the cwd.

---@param vim_cmd string already validated by preview_policy
