---@module 'cmdlog.ui.preview_policy'
--- Decides what a picker is allowed to do to preview a history entry.
---
--- Both previewers (`ui.telescope-previewer`, `ui.fzf-previewer`) used to
--- answer this question inline, and both answered it the same wrong way: they
--- *ran* the entry. Moving the cursor onto `:!rm -rf build` in the picker ran
--- `rm -rf build`; onto `:lua vim.fn.delete(x)` deleted `x` again; onto
--- `:term <cmd>` spawned the command. That is not a preview, and the entries
--- are not necessarily even the user's own: `extra_files` folds arbitrary
--- plain-text files in as history sources, and shell history is folded in too.
---
--- So the rule here is: **a preview reads, it does not run.** Reading a file
--- for `:edit <file>` is a preview. Executing anything is not, and needs
--- `preview_execute = true` — off by default, and refused outright for an
--- entry matching `risky_patterns`, which is the list that already names the
--- destructive commands.
---
--- Arguments are validated here rather than at each call site, because the
--- previewers interpolate them into a Vim `-c` string (where `|` separates
--- commands) and, on the fzf side, into a shell string. `:help x | !cmd` was
--- a working command injection through exactly that path.

---A preview decision.

--- What makes an argument dangerous depends on where it is interpolated, so
--- there are two checks rather than one blanket filter. A single filter strict
--- enough for a shell word rejects `vim.fn.getcwd()` for its parentheses --
